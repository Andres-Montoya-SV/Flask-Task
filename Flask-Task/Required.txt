          but is open to any suggestions).--------------------------------------------------> DONE
        ○ A service that would allow to save the top 20 podcasts to a separate JSON File ---> DONE
        ○ A service to replace the top 20 podcasts for the bottom 20 to said JSON File
        ○ A service to remove a podcast, using a given identifier (defined by you).---------> DONE

    ■ Use a Database (suggested: SQLite), instead of the JSON File. Include a
      create schema in the repo and instructions on how to implement it.
      oAdd authentication API endpoint(s)
    ■ Create a service to return the podcasts grouped by genres, even if
      they appear as duplicates within some of the categories.
